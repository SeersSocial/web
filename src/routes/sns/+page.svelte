                    <h3 class="text-sky-600">Introduction</h3>
                    <p>ICX is a Web3 decentralized, fully on-chain social network built atop the groundbreaking technology of the Internet Computer. Drawing inspiration from Twitter's intuitive design, ICX improves user interaction with exclusive crypto features like prediction markets. This platform allows you to voice your thoughts and use cryptocurrencies to predict future events. But this is merely the beginning. We envision ICX evolving into a vibrant platform akin to Elon Musk's 'X', with the potential to redefine global interactions and transactions.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-sky-600">Prediction Markets</h3>
                    <p>
                        Prediction markets are financial markets where users can buy and sell shares based on the outcome of future events. By aggregating information and opinions from a large number of people, prediction markets provide more accurate predictions of event likelihoods.
                        For example, football fans can use ICP tokens as collateral to trade shares for the UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Shares include "Real Madrid Wins," "Bayern Munich Wins," and "Match Ends in Draw." Users can stake ICP tokens to buy and sell these shares based on their predictions. Share prices fluctuate based on user activity and sentiment. After the final, winning shares can be exchanged back for ICP tokens, while unsuccessful shares result in the loss of the staked ICP collateral. In this way, ICX offers an interactive way for football enthusiasts to leverage ICP and participate in the excitement of the championship match.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-sky-600">ICX' Accomplishments and Decentralised Future</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Over the past year, ICX conducted extensive product-market fit experiments, featuring 200 prediction markets and engaging 3,000 users. Additionally, our community has created over 10,000 posts, reflecting active participation.</li>
                        <li>These efforts have resulted in a remarkable Total Value Locked (TVL) of $15,000 in ICP and an estimated yearly revenue of $25,000.</li>
                        <li>Importantly, we have recently distributed part of the revenue to our users according to their contributions over the previous month, with some members earning up to $100 per week.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        While we consider these figures modest, we firmly believe that we will experience exponential growth as we continue to develop our roadmap and tap into the full potential of the Internet Computer's capabilities.
                        Decentralization is crucial to ramp up liquidity and deploy more powerful features, as outlined in the next section, which allows us to foster a truly user-driven and resilient ecosystem.

                <span slot="header">Token allocation at SNS genesis</span>
                <div  class="space-y-4">
                    The SNS will be initialized with 100 million ICX tokens allocated in the following proportions.
                    <img alt="" class="w-300 my-2" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fdf1d2afe-e21c-41dc-bac3-0f0fcc6ef3a9%2FScreenshot_2023-07-23_at_18.43.20.png?table=block&id=4e61041d-1358-4652-88d5-a0ac17c1d3fe&spaceId=99cf4b46-040e-4088-b8a9-635bbdc239a0&width=2000&userId=35d25b55-082d-4e6c-83cf-28ce5dc9dd4f&cache=v2"/>    
                    <h3 class="text-sky-600">Decentralization Sale</h3>

                    <p>To decentralize governance and raise funds for the ICX SNS, a total of 25% of the token supply will be made available for sale. The maximum amount that can be raised through this sale will be set at 1,000,000 ICP, while the minimum will be 500,000 ICP.</p>

                    <p>We are seeking a contribution of 333,333 ICP from the Neuron Fund (NF), with the remaining 666,667 ICP to be raised from participants in the decentralization sale.</p>

                    <p>During the sale, participants will deposit ICP into the SNS. Once the sale concludes, they will receive ICX tokens in proportion to their share of the deposited ICP. Each participant will receive their ICX tokens in the form of a basket containing 5 neurons of equal value. The first neuron will have no dissolve delay, allowing for immediate disbursement of liquid ICX tokens. The remaining neurons will have dissolve delays of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively.</p>

                    <p>Participants from the Neuron Fund will also receive their share of tokens as a basket of 5 neurons, following the same configuration as described above.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="text-sky-600">Founders and Funders</h3>

                    <p>The ICX team has been diligently developing and running ICX since July 2022. Following the SNS sale of ICX tokens, the ICX Foundation will be established. The foundation will receive 15% (15,000,000) of the ICX tokens, distributed across 5 equal neurons. Each of these neurons will have a dissolve delay of 1 month, with "vesting periods" set at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively.</p>

                    <p>Seed funders, on the other hand, will receive 8% of the ICX tokens as a basket of 5 equal neurons. Each neuron will have a dissolve delay of 1 month and "vesting periods" of 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively.</p>

                    <p>It is important to note that neurons with a "vesting period" cannot be accessed until the specified period has elapsed, including any potential extension of the dissolve delay. This mechanism ensures that founders and funders are prevented from rug-pulling investors and provides a continuous incentive to drive the success of ICX.</p>

                    <p>Since these founder/funder neurons have relatively short dissolve delays of 1 month that cannot be extended, it ensures reduced voting power compared to the community. This intentional design ensures proper decentralization of governance, empowering the community to have a significant say in shaping the future of ICX.</p>
                    <img alt="" class="w-300 my-2" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F255aec2c-c158-4045-8e99-c6438f67245f%2FScreenshot_2023-07-23_at_18.43.44.png?table=block&id=910ab51c-abd7-4c0c-aa2d-bed62b1a973c&spaceId=99cf4b46-040e-4088-b8a9-635bbdc239a0&width=2000&userId=35d25b55-082d-4e6c-83cf-28ce5dc9dd4f&cache=v2"/>    
                    
                    <h3 class="text-sky-600">SNS Treasury</h3>

                    <p>Following the decentralization sale, the SNS will retain a treasury consisting of the remaining 52% of ICX tokens. This treasury will serve various purposes to support the growth and development of ICX.</p>

                    <p>The majority of the tokens will be utilized over time to automatically reward content moderators, fostering a thriving content ecosystem and facilitating the expansion of ICX. Additionally, the treasury will be available to fund community bounties through SNS proposals, compensating individuals who contribute to ICX in various ways. This includes rewarding third-party developers for their valuable code contributions.</p>

                    <p>A small portion, approximately 2%, will be allocated to provide initial liquidity pools for decentralized exchanges (DEXes). To enable the trading of ICX tokens, it is essential to list ICX on one or more exchanges. The intention is to list ICX on IC-based DEXes. Listing ICX on a DEX that implements an Automated Market Maker (AMM) requires the provision of a liquidity pool consisting of ICX tokens and another token, in this case, ICP raised from the decentralization sale. The plan is to make ICX available on multiple DEXes as they become available. Each DEX listing will require a proposal to transfer a specific amount of ICX from the SNS to the DEX, along with a corresponding proposal to transfer an equal value of ICP from the SNS to the DEX.</p>

                    <p>The SNS treasury plays a crucial role in supporting the ICX ecosystem, rewarding contributors, promoting liquidity, and facilitating the growth and accessibility of the ICX token on decentralized exchanges.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="text-sky-600">Valuation Range</h3>

                    <p>The inclusion of a maximum target is intended to provide participants with a guaranteed minimum allocation of ICX tokens in exchange for their ICP investment. With a lower bound of 500,000 ICP and an upper bound of 1,000,000 ICP for 25% of the tokens, the ICX DAO achieves an initial valuation range between 2M ICP and 4M ICP. Consequently, the initial value of 1 ICX token would range from 0.02 ICP to 0.04 ICP. This valuation range ensures transparency and establishes a framework for participants to assess the potential value of their investment in the ICX ecosystem.</p>
